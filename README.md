### Hi there 👋

Hi, I am Ravikant, a Full-Stack Developer in a startup at Bangalore, India. I hold an M.Tech (2018) in Computer Science & Engineering from National Institute of Technology Durgapur & B.Tech (2016) in Computer Science & Engineering from ABES Engineering College, Ghaziabad. I am from Delhi-NCR, India.

I have worked as a Teaching Assistant at National Institute of Technology Durgapur during my Masters.

I was fortunate enough to know from a young age that I wanted to be an Engineer. The engineering way of thinking came naturally to me. What I didn't know was what type of engineer I wanted to be. When push came to shove, I chose Computer Science & Engineering.

My hobbies are writing poetry, photography & travelling. I write poetry, to capture feelings I experienced or I couldn't express. I click pictures, to capture the most beautiful moments of our lives, moments which we cannot ever return to, but we can capture them up in the form of photos. I travelled almost all over India to fulfil my natural curiosity to go where I haven’t gone before and see what I haven’t seen before. I prefer mountains over the sea and I am a "Look at the Moon!" Person.

I also like watching good cinema, playing video games, solving Rubik’s cube, Competitive Programming and loads of other stuff. I am an ardent listener of songs, ranging from Classical, Rap, hip hop, Sufi to Hindi, English & Punjabi and a big fan of Lucky Ali Sir.
